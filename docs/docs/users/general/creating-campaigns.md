## About campaigns
Campaigns is where Wings really shines: they allow you to to create meaningful and effective ways that allow users to contribute to your cause by attending events, signing a petition or making a donation. A quick overview:

- Signups are simple forms that let people 'sign up', for example to receive newsletter updates.
- Events are geared towards getting people to visit an event. 
- Petitions are aimed towards letting people sign a policy proposal, letter of support or some other kind of petition.
- Fundraisers will allow users to make a monetary donation.

## Campaigns on the frontend
Campaigns can be shown on the frontend in two ways:

1. Every campaign gets its own 'slug'; most Wings web applications will make each campaign publicly accessible at this slug on the frontend, inside its respective campaign directory. For example, a petition with the slug `my-petition` will typically be found at `mywebsite.com/petitions/my-petition`. Events and fundraisers will be found in `/events/` and `/fundraisers/`, respectively.

2. You can also place campaign on a regular content page or article page, by using a 'campaign card'.

## The Campaigns Overview 
1. Click 'Campaigns' in the Wings admin Main Menu to visit the Campaigns Overview page. 
2. On the Campaigns Overview page, you will find a list of saved campaigns (click a campaign's title to visit its edit page) and 3) the option to create a new campaign page. Clicking the 'new' button will prompt you to choose a campaign type (Signup, Petition, Event or Fundraiser).

## Editing a campaign
When you create a new campaign or edit an existing one, you will find yourself on the campaign edit screen as shown below.

## Settings
At Settings, you can configure an optional connection with a Mailchimp List. It requires that you add a Mailchimp Api Key on the general settings page. If you provide a valid API key, you will find a list of Mailchimp lists. Upon selecting a Mailchimp list, you will be able to map campaign fields to Mailchimp list fields.

be the default settings for social media as well; if you want to have Facebook / Twitter / WhatsApp have different values, you can set these as well - but this is optional.

## Event settings
Events have a couple of additional settings, pertaining to the event date and the location details which are displayed on the frontend as well.

## Configuring the confirmation emails
All campaigns only record a user's information after they have clicked a confirmation link in the email that is sent by Wings. Note: all campaigns of a certain campaign type get the same email. In other words: petition signers will receive the same petition confirmation email regardless of the petition being signed.

1. Visit Settings -> Emails to configure the emails.
2. Set the 'From' name.
3. Choose which campaign type you want to configure the emails for.
4. Write an email subject line.
5. Here, you can drag content blocks from the right to the left, in order to add them to your email.

1. When you click on a content field, you can edit it. 
2. On the right side, you will find various ways to edit the layout and design of your content field.
3. If you click inside a text field, you will find a layout toolbar. The 'Personalize' is important: it lets you add the dynamic placeholders for First Name, Last Name and the confirmation link: `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}` and `{{confirmationLink}}` respectively. These placeholder will be transformed into the signer's first and last name and a unique confirmation link that, when clicked, will take the user to the 'Confirmed' landing page and will make sure their submission is valid.
