Campaigns is where Wings really shines: they allow you to to create meaningful and effective ways that allow users to contribute to your cause by attending events, signing a petition or making a donation. A quick overview:

- Events are geared towards getting people to visit an event. 
- Petitions are aimed towards letting people sign a policy proposal, letter of support or some other kind of petition.
- Fundraisers will allow users to make a monetary donation.

## Campaigns on the frontend
Campaigns can be shown on the frontend in two ways:

1. Every campaign gets its own 'slug'  by which it is publicly accessible on the frontend, inside its respective campaign directory. For example, a petition with the slug `my-petition` will typically be found at `mywebsite.com/petitions/my-petition`. Events and fundraisers will be found in `/events/` and `/fundraisers/`, respectively.

2. You can also place campaign on a regular content page or article page, by using a 'campaign card'.

## The Campaigns Overview 
1. Click 'Campaigns' in the Wings admin Main Menu to visit the Campaigns Overview page. 
2. On the Campaigns Overview page, you will find a list of saved campaigns (click a campaign's title to visit its edit page) and 3) the option to create a new campaign page. Clicking the 'new' button will prompt you to choose a campaign type (Petition, Event or Fundraiser).

## Editing a campaign
When you create a new campaign or edit an existing one, you will find yourself on the campaign edit screen as shown below.
