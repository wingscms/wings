Here is more information about campaigns. These can be either petition campaigns, event campaigns or fundraising campaigns. 

## General info

At Campaigns, you can manage 1) Events or 2) Petitions. You can 3) click on existing campaign to edit it, or 4) Create a new one. 

Events are geared towards getting people to visit an event; petitions are aimed towards letting people sign a policy proposal, letter of support or some other kind of petition. 

## Where is your campaign page?
Campaigns get their own page on your website by default; by defining the 'slug', you define its url.  Every type of campaign has its own directory, though; if your slug is 'demo-fundraiser' and your website url is mywebsite.com, the url of this specific fundraiser page can be found at 'mywebsite.com/fundraisers/demo-fundraiser'.

The general 'search engines' Title / Desciptions / image will be the default settings for social media as well; if you want to have Facebook / Twitter / WhatsApp have different values, you can set these as well - but this is optional. 

A couple of additional search engine / social media settings can be configured with meta values, see meta-values#social-media-settings
