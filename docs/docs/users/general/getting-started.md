Hi! This is the manual for [Wings](https://wings.dev) websites. Wings consists of a 'headless' CMS service which allows you to add and edit content & campaigns from its admin interface located at [admin.wings.dev](https://admin.wings.dev). Changes made there will trigger a new deployment of your web application, which takes a minute or two. 

This manual details how to perform the most important editorial tasks. It is for now divided into three parts: general [settings](settings.md), [publishing](publish.md) articles & pages, and creating & managing [campaigns](creating-campaigns.md).
