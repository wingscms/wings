Hi! This is the manual for [Wings](https://wings.dev) websites. Wings allows you to add and edit content & campaigns from its admin interface located at [admin.wings.dev](https://admin.wings.dev).  

This manual details how to perform the most important editorial tasks. It is for now divided into three parts: general [settings](settings.md), [publishing](publish.md) articles & pages, and creating & managing [campaigns](creating-campaigns.md).

The following YouTube video may also serve as a helpful introduction to Wings; it covers the basics of publishing pages, articles and campaigns.
