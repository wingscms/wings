## About articles and pages

At Articles you can add and edit articles; at Pages, you can add and edit pages. The interface is very similar for both, but articles tend to be used for news articles and 'stories', typically with a bigger splash screen, whereas 'pages' are used for general information pages. Here are the basics.

## General editing

1. General: this tab is open by default. It's where you write the content.
2. Platforms: SEO and social media optimization settings are to be found here.
3. Meta: add metadata to do special things on the frontend. See the [Meta values manual](/meta-values).
4. The title goes here.
5. The slug goes here. These should contain only lowercase letters without spaces, but dashes (`-`) are allowed and recommended. For example, `hello-world` is a good slug when your title is `Hello, World!`.
6. Add a header image.
7. Here you will see a blinking cursor. Start typing away!
8. Add headings
9. Unordered lists. Usually styled with bullets.
10. Ordered lists. Like 1, 2, 3 and so on. You are reading an ordered list right now.
11. Select text and hit this button to style your text **strong**. Don't use it for entire paragraphs, though.
12. 'Em' is for *emphasis*. Usually styled as *italicized text* on the frontend.
13. This is for `code`. 
14. This is for links.


## Adding content cards 
There are several pre-made content cards you can use. Place your cursor on the spot where you would like to add such a card, and you can simply configure it. 

### Adding an image
For example, adding an image is straightforward. However, it assumes you have already uploaded one on the 'Media' page. Inserting it is easy:

## Adding custom cards
With custom cards, you get many additional options. Adding an empty one is easy:
