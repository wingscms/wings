## About articles and pages

At Articles you can add and edit articles; at Pages, you can add and edit pages. The interface is very similar for both, but articles tend to be used for news articles and 'stories', typically with a bigger splash screen, whereas 'pages' are used for general information pages.

1. Click 'Content' in the main menu.
2. Choose between Articles and Pages. Depending on your selection, you will find a list of existing articles and pages below.
3. Click here to create a new article or page.

## Editing an article or page

1. General: this tab is open by default. It's where you write the content.
2. Platforms: SEO and social media optimization settings are to be found here.
3. Meta: Meta is used to attach arbitrary information to this 'node' (pages, articles and campaigns are all 'nodes'), which may be incorporated into the web application. You will probably receive specific instructions from a website developer if you are to use this.
4. Apps: if you need to edit specific settings related to the frontend application, this is where you need to be. For example, you can set a main navigation menu that this page should show on the frontend, if it needs to be different from the one that is set as a default main menu.
5. The title goes here.
6. The slug goes here. These should contain only lowercase letters without spaces, but dashes (`-`) are allowed and recommended. For example, `hello-world` is a good slug when your title is `Hello, World!`. Pages will by default have your main website domain + their slug as their public url, for example `https://www.yourwebsite.com/hello-world`. Articles are typically placed in a directory called `articles`, for example `https://www.yourwebsite.com/articles/hello-world`.
7. You can set the language for this page here.
8. Here you will see a blinking cursor. Start typing away!
9. This is the layout toolbar, which works similar to other CMS'es and word editing applications. You can use it to add headings, unordered lists (usually styled with bullets), ordered (numbered) lists, **strong**, `code` and [https://example.com](links).
10. A 'card' is a special content block, which will be explained in the next section.


## Adding content cards
There are several pre-made content cards you can use, ranging from images to pullquotes and from campaign cards to collections of persons.

### Inserting a content card

1. Place your cursor on the spot where you would like to insert a card. 
2. Click 'Card' in the toolbar.
3. Choose the kind of content card you want to use.
4. Click on the content card you just inserted into your page to edit and configure it. Depending on the card, you will find various content fields you can edit.

### Types of content cards
A brief overview of the content cards is listed below. You can visit the [demo article with all elements](https://demo.wings.dev/articles/all-elements) to see what they look like by default.

- Header: a chapter title and description, which typically is used to create an in-page navigation menu to skip to certain headers/chapters.
- Image: a single image, which has to be uploaded on the 'Media' page beforehand. It can be used with various layout types ('sizes').
- Quote: either a blockquote or a pullquote. 
- Campaign: an inserted petition, event or fundraiser campaign. 
- Embed: an inserted YouTube or Vimeo video.
- Insight: a short big quote.
- Testimonial: an image + story with a special layout which lends itself to personal stories.
- Q&A: questions and answers.
- CTA: a Call to Action element with a title, description, and a link button.
- Collection: a grid or list which can show either Persons or Organizations.
- Data: this is a custom card type that may be used in custom projects. If you need to use this, you will receive specific instructions from your web developer.

## Platforms: SEO & Social
At the Platforms tab, you can configure settings for search engines and social media.

1. Click the 'Platforms' tab.
2. Choose a title. This will be the title that Google and social media platforms will index and display.
3. Write a description.
4. Choose a meta image. An image of 1200 * 630 is generally advised.
5. By default, you are editing the 'Search Engines' tab which configures settings for both search engines like Google as well as social media platforms. However, if you want to have Facebook or Twitter index & display different meta data, you can navigate to those settings pages and configure these. Note: Twitter & WhatsApp settings, if left empty will inherit the settings you configure for Facebook. Also, if you configure settings for social media, you should edit the title, description *and* the meta image.
